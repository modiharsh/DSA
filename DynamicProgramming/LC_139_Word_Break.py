    def wordBreak(self, s: str, wordDict: List[str]) -> bool:
        word_set = set(wordDict)
        dp = [False] * (len(s)+1)

        return dp[len(s)]


# Example 1:

# Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]
# Output: true
# Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
# Output: true
# Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
# Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
# Example 3:

# Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
# Output: false
